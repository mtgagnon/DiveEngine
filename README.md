#Dive Engine

This project uses CMake to build the project on your machine so making it should be fairly simple!
Setting up the project: 
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Go in the folder and once there choose a spot to build the project, I use a folder called build!
    3. Once in the build folder run the cmake command to build using my CMakeLists.txt, for my setup to make an XCode project I use this command: cmake -G "Xcode" ..
    4. Open up your project! Make sure your working directory is where your resources folder is or it won't find your resources folder!

Have fun!
